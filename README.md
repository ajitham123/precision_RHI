# Precision not Prediction: Rubber Hand Illusion and Body Ownership
The code accompanying the paper "Precision not prediction: Body-ownership illusion as a consequence of online precision adaptation under Bayesian inference"

The code implements the body-ownership computational model based on precision (online precision learning and maximum posterior precision model selection under free energy principle).
